Home Network Configuration and Topology Documentation

1. Overview / Objective
This document outlines the configuration and architecture of my basic home network setup designed for learning and lab practice. It includes details on topology, device roles, IP schema, and security configurations.

2. Network Diagram
(See Home Network Topology. jpec

3. Device List And Roles (I subbed IP and Mac Addesses Information Out) 
| Device Name  | Device Type  | IP Address    | MAC Address            | Role               |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Router       | TP-Link AX10 | 192.168.1.1   | 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E      | Gateway, DHCP, DNS |
| Desktop      | Windows 10   | 192.168.1.100 | 00\:AA\:BB\:CC\:DD\:EE | Client Device      |
| Laptop       | Windows 10   | 192.168.1.200 | 00:11:22:33:44:55      | Client Device      |
| Smartphone   | Android      | DHCP Assigned | 12:34:56:78:90\:AB     | Wireless Client    |

4.IP Addressing Scheme
Subnet: 192.168.1.0/24
Gateway: 192.168.1.1
DHCP Range: 192.168.1.100 - 192.168.1.150
Static IPs: Reserved for servers and testing devices

5. Router Configuration
SSID: HomeLab_Network
Encryption: WPA2-Personal
Admin Password: Changed from default

6. Security Measures
Changed default login credentials on all devices
Performed regular firmware updates
Performed Updates on all Devices
Unistall all Bloatware

7. Testing and Validation
Verified connectivity via ping and tracert (powershell)
Verified DHCP leasing and DNS resolution
Used nslookup and ipconfig for troubleshooting

8. Lessons Learned / Improvements
Consider setting up VLANs for better segmentation
Plan to implement IDS/IPS with a pfSense VM
Plan to test VPN tunneling for remote access
